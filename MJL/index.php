		<h2>ISI journals</h2>
		<p>
			In many academic institutions researchers are asked to publish in ISI
			journals, due to its inclusion in many rankings such as <a
				href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings">QS</a>,
			<a href="http://www.arwu.org/">ARWU</a>, <a

				Higher Education</a>.

		<h2>Flexible search</h2>
		<p>
			For some reason the poeple at Thomson uses a very old search
			technology that doesn't help researches finding the journals they're
			seeking. In their <a href="http://ip-science.thomsonreuters.com/mjl/">Master
				Journal List</a> you can search journals by title or keyword, but it
			just doesn't work.

		<h2>Good Guy Google Scholar</h2>
		<p>Google Scholar is THE tool that helps PhD students around the world
			to do their literature reviews, not to mention trying to reach the
			ellusive PDF files of some obscure publications. We built this
			journals search for easy integration with Google Scholar, obviously
			because they do their job like noone.</p>
